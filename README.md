In this repository you will find :

**1 :** A folder named Data

1i) It contains the data of different stars, used in this project.

**2 :** A folder named Code

2i) It contains the code

## Description of the Project

The purpose of the project is to create an Artificial Neural Network that will classify stars according to H-R diagram.

Half of the data was used for the training while the other half for testing.

The input level consists of 4 nodes and the output layer consist of 6 nodes as many as are the classes. There is no hidden layer. The error in the output is calculated via cross-entropy. The maximum number of training cycles is 1000 and the learning rate is n=0.8.
